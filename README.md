## PROFESSIONAL PROFILE

After 9 years working in sales, almost 5 of them in a management position, I pursued my dream of being a data scientist: of digging down deep in the data (lots of them and of all kinds) and being able to extract unobserved patterns, infer causality through randomized experiments, and make reliable predictions and well-informed decisions.
