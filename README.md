## PROFESSIONAL PROFILE

After 9 years working in sales, in the Test & Measurement industry, I pursued my dream of being a data scientist: of digging down deep in the data (lots of them and of all kinds) and being able to extract unobserved patterns, infer causality through randomized experiments, and make reliable predictions and well-informed decisions.

I am a business person, so I am most interested in applying experiments and machine learning/data mining techniques to marketing and customer behavior.

## PROJECTS

(See https://juanjocarin.github.io for additional information.)

### Master of Information and Data Science

+ 2016: SmartCam (https://smart-cam.github.io/)
    
    Capstone project: a scalable cloud-based video monitoring system (with motion detection, face counting, and image recognition) using Raspberry Pis. Most of the processing (using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow) is done in the cloud, so the computing power of the Raspberry Pi is not a limitation.

+ 2015: Implementation of the shortest path (https://goo.gl/QKYSdC) and PageRank (https://goo.gl/KLXrcL) algorithms using the Wikipedia graph dataset
    
    Two of the assignments of the Machine Learning at Scale course. Using MrJob (in Python) with a graph dataset of almost half a million nodes.

+ 2015: Forest Cover Type Prediction (https://goo.gl/UJhfqh)
    
    Final project of the Machine Learning course (a Kaggle competition): predictions of the predominant kind of tree cover in four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado, from strictly cartographic variables such as elevation and soil type, using Python.

+ 2015: Redefining the job search process (https://goo.gl/8yeXo3)
    
    Final project of the Storing and Retrieving Data course: a pipeline using Hadoop, Hive, and Spark, that combines data from Indeed API and the U.S. Census Bureau to select the best locations for data scientists based on the number of job postings, housing cost, etc.

+ 2015: A fresh perspective on Citi Bike (http://goo.gl/WYrgwJ)
    
    Final project of the Data Visualization and Communication course: an interactive website to visualize NYC Citi Bike bicycle sharing service, using Tableau.

+ 2015: Investigating the Effect of Competition on the Ability to Solve Arithmetic Problems (https://goo.gl/UhZznO)
    
    Final project of the Field Experiments course: a randomized controlled experiment in which 300+ participants were assigned to a control group or one of two test groups to evaluate the effect of competition (being compared to no one or someone better or worse). Analysis of the results using R.

### M.S. in Statistical and Computational Information Processing

+ 2014: Experimental design to measure the impact of online advertising on the sales of a car manufacturer's dealer network (https://goo.gl/15mW5V)
    
    Capstone project (working for Conento): a project for Google Spain to measure the effect of YouTube ads. Responsible for the whole project (excluding the model to estimate the increase in advertising spend in the test group): designed a matched-pair, cluster-randomized experiment, which involved selecting the test and control groups from a sample of 50+ cities in Spain based on their sales-wise similarity over time (using R).

+ 2014: Prediction of customer churn for a mobile network carrier (https://goo.gl/0TdvqM)
    
    Final project of the Data Mining course: predictions from a sample of 45,000+ customers, using tree decisions, logistic regression and neural networks (in SAS Enterprise Miner).

+ 2014: Different models of Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) in Spain (https://goo.gl/nqn9kr)
    
    Final project of the Time Series course: forecasts based on exponential smoothing, ARIMA, and transfer  function (using petrol price as independent variable) models, using SPSS (and Demetra+).
