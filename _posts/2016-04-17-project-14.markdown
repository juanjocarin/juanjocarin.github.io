description: 'I was impressed by the presentation Juanjo made in my class on research design and applications for data analysis. Juanjo demonstrated great storytelling skills, giving a convincing demonstration of the need for his proposal. He can articulate a good research question &ndash; simple, direct, specific, and yet still challenging &ndash; and can handle tough questions from an audience. He has a strong grasp of research design, with really great description of why he recommended the adoption of an experimental design and good discussion of the method itself.'
