                    <p>I am originally from Madrid, Spain (I moved to the SF Bay Area in February 2015). While I was earning my <a href="http://www.etsit.upm.es/de/studies/telecommunication-engineer-p94.html" target="_blank">master's in Telecommunication Engineering</a>, I worked at Ericsson and later as a tutor of differential and integral calculus, physics, and digital electronic circuits (I love teaching!). After that, I worked 9 years in the Test &amp; Measurement industry: first as a sales engineer at a distributor of T&amp;M solutions (for all kinds of telecom networks: mobile, Ethernet, CaTV, WiFi, ...), and later at Yokogawa (whose oscilloscopes, DAQ systems, and power analyzers are aimed at industries such as energy, transportation, and power electronics; hence, I had to move from bits to volts and from dBm to megawatts), where I soon became sales director of the T&amp;M division for Spain and Portugal. My work mainly involved helping organizations to get data (from telecom networks first, and then from wind farms, solar parks, nuclear plants, transformers, electric motors, and so on) to check that everything worked properly and conforming to standards, and more importantly, to find any problem and its cause. Above all, it meant caring about customers' needs.</p>

                    <p>I really liked my job, but I also wanted to be in an even more technical position. I've loved math problems<a href="#fn1" name="fr1" class="fn"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and puzzles since I was a kid, and I didn't even have to look for them: if I was at Starbucks and saw 14 people using a laptop, 9 (64.3%) of them being a Mac, I found myself wondering if it could be said that the number of Macs was significantly higher than the number of PCs<a href="#fn2" name="fr2" class="fn"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. And I was always trying to get valuable insights from the reduced amount of sales data we had (it was a small market). I eventually realized that I wanted to dig down deeper in the data (lots of it and of all kinds!) and be able to extract unobserved patterns, infer causality through experiments, and make reliable predictions and well-informed decisions; I wanted to be a data scientist. That's why I went back to my <em>alma mater</em> to earn another Master's degree<!--<a href="#fn2" name="fr2" class="fn"><sup>[2]</sup></a>-->, this time in Statistics, and right after that another one in Data Science from UC Berkeley.</p>

In December 2016 I joined Yahoo, now <a href="https://www.oath.com/our-brands/" target="_blank">Oath / Verizon Media</a>, where I have had the opportunity to work with very talented people in many exciting projects, mainly for Web Search and also, lately, for Mail and Verizon (returning, after several years, to the telecom industry).</p>
